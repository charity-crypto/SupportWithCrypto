Health is a Basic Human Right

In many regions, access to medical care is scarce, and treatable illnesses often lead to preventable deaths. Lack of healthcare infrastructure and basic medicines leaves millions vulnerable, especially during outbreaks and natural disasters. We believe that everyone deserves the right to quality healthcare, regardless of their financial situation.
