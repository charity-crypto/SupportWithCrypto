No One Should Go Hungry

In many impoverished communities, hunger and malnutrition are daily realities. Children are particularly vulnerable, facing developmental delays and health issues that can last a lifetime. Malnutrition affects more than just health; it impacts education, future earnings, and overall quality of life.
